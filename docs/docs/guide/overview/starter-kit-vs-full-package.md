# Starter-kit vs Full Package

### Starter kit

Starter-kit is minimal template from where you can start your project quickly instead of removing stuff which ins't needed. Below is quick notes on starter-kit:

- No Auth
- No i18n
- Simple Navbar
- Four Pages (Two sample pages + 404 + Login)
- No Customizer
- No Scroll to top

Use it if you don't want to clutter your project with extra libs which are not required.

Our Starter Kit is tailored for efficiency with minimal dependencies, making it perfect to just get started.
We've carefully eliminated any unnecessary code to ensure it's as streamlined as possible. <br/>
While the Full Version includes a broader range of dependencies for its extensive features, the Starter Kit allows for the addition of specific components from the Full Version as needed. Most components from the Full Version are compatible with the Starter Kit and can be integrated without requiring extra dependencies, providing flexibility to enhance your project's functionality at your own pace.

:::tip
Use starter-kit to provide reproduction steps if you raise any technical issue on [Github](/docs/guide/overview/getting-support).

### Full Package

This setup have all the things which you can see in live demo. Except that Buy Now button ðŸ˜….

With this you have to remove things which you don't use or replace them with your content.

### Conclusion

According to us, starter-kit is easy to get started with minimal setup and our folder and code structure will help you adding libs support in starter-kit more easily than ever. Still if your project becomes easy with full package go for it.
