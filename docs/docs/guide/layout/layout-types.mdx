# Layout Types

:::tip
Before diving into our specific layout types, we highly recommend reviewing the [**Layout Docs of NextJS**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts). This will give you a foundational understanding of how layouts function in Next.js, setting the stage for you to fully appreciate the unique features of our layouts.

## Overview

Our application supports three primary layout types to cater to diverse UI needs:

- [Vertical Layout](#vertical-layout),
- [Horizontal Layout](#horizontal-layout) and
- [Blank Layout](#blank-layout).

Each layout type is designed with flexibility and customization in mind.

## Vertical Layout

The Vertical Layout serves as the default configuration. It includes these key components:

- **Navigation Menu**: Positioned on the left side, providing easy access to different sections
- **Navbar**: Located at the top, it offers some actions
- **Content**: The main section for displaying page-specific content
- **Footer**: Situated at the bottom, it typically contains auxiliary information or links.

For detailed information about each component and customization options, visit [Vertical Layout Components](/docs/guide/layout/vertical-layout-components).

## Horizontal Layout

Opt for the Horizontal Layout to give your application a different feel. This layout includes:

- **Navbar**: At the very top, similar to the Vertical Layout
- **Navigation Menu**: Positioned below the Navbar, spanning horizontally
- **Content**: The main section for displaying page-specific content
- **Footer**: Like in the Vertical Layout, it's at the bottom of the page.

For detailed information about each component and customization options, visit [Horizontal Layout Components](/docs/guide/layout/horizontal-layout-components).

## Blank Layout

The Blank Layout is your canvas for pages where a standard layout is unnecessary or undesirable, such as login or registration pages. It's a clean slate, allowing complete freedom in design and structure.

This layout type offers no predefined components, giving you full creative control to build from the ground up.
