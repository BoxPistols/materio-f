# Menu Utils

We provide a set of utilities to help you build your menu. These utilities are available in the `src/@menu-package/utils/menuUtils.tsx` file. Have a look at the following utilities:

#### generateVerticalMenu

This utility generates a vertical menu based on an array of menu data. It utilizes the map function to iterate over the menu data array and generate the corresponding menu items, submenus and menu sections.

#### generateHorizontalMenu

With this utility, you can generate a horizontal menu from an array of menu data. Similar to the previous utility, it utilizes the map function to iterate over the menu data array and generate the respective menu items and submenus.

#### confirmUrlInChildren

This utility function is used to match the current URL with the URL of all the menu items (even inside all the nested submenus). It returns true if the URL is found; otherwise, it returns false. This is basically used to determine whether a menu item should be active or not.

#### mapHorizontalToVerticalMenu

This function facilitates the mapping of a horizontal menu to a vertical menu. Through recursion, it iterates over the menu data array, generating the corresponding menu items and submenus in the vertical menu.

The reason behind mapping the children of the horizontal-menu component to the vertical-menu component is that the Horizontal menu components will not work inside of Vertical menu on small screens. So, we have to map the children of the horizontal-menu components to the vertical-menu components. We also kept the same names and almost similar props for menuitem and submenu components for easy mapping.

#### renderMenuIcon

This function renders all the icons for all the menu items and submenus with a level greater than 0.

## How to override the menu utils

Users have the option to override the menu utilities according to their requirements. You need to create a new file (you can name the file whichever you want; let us say that you have named `src/utils/userMenuUtils.tsx` file) for the same. You need to copy the code of any utility function from the `src/@menu-package/utils/menuUtils.tsx` file and paste it in the newly created file and make the changes according to your needs.

For example if you want to override the `generateVerticalMenu` function and add a default `className` prop to the `MenuSection` component, you can do it the following way:

```tsx title="src/utils/userMenuUtils.tsx"
// For TypeScript
export const generateVerticalMenu = (menuData: VerticalMenuDataType[]) => {
  ...
  return (
    <MenuSection key={index} className='yourCustomClass' {...rest}>
      {children && generateVerticalMenu(children)}
    </MenuSection>
  )
  ...
}
```

```jsx title="src/utils/userMenuUtils.js"
// For JavaScript
export const generateVerticalMenu = menuData => {
  ...
  return (
    <MenuSection key={index} className='yourCustomClass' {...rest}>
      {children && generateVerticalMenu(children)}
    </MenuSection>
  )
  ...
}
```

You need to import this function in any file where you wish to utilize it.

That's it!
