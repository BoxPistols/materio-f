### Why Migrating from My Existing Materio Project to the New Materio Template is Not Possible?

Migrating from Materio with Next.js Page Router to the Materio Next.js App Router is not straightforward. Fundamental differences in routing require significant code changes.

### Why Is Direct Migration Not Possible?

The Materio App Router introduces a distinct design, optimized for advanced use cases and flexibility, which is not compatible with conventional page-based routing.

### Considerations for Current Materio Applications

Adopting the new App Router in an existing Materio application involves significant code updates, including page management, component updates, and potentially data handling adjustments.

### Options for Materio Users

- **New Projects:** Start with the Materio template and the App Router.
- **Existing Projects:** Continue with the current router, unless a complete rebuild is feasible.

### Further Information

For in-depth understanding and integration guidelines, refer to the [Next.js Official Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration).
