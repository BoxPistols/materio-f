### Why Migrating from My Existing Master Project to the New Master Template is Not Possible?

Migrating from Master with Next.js Page Router to the Master Next.js App Router is not straightforward. Fundamental differences in routing require significant code changes.

### Why Is Direct Migration Not Possible?

The Master App Router introduces a distinct design, optimized for advanced use cases and flexibility, which is not compatible with conventional page-based routing.

### Considerations for Current Master Applications

Adopting the new App Router in an existing Master application involves significant code updates, including page management, component updates, and potentially data handling adjustments.

### Options for Master Users

- **New Projects:** Start with the Master template and the App Router.
- **Existing Projects:** Continue with the current router, unless a complete rebuild is feasible.

### Further Information

For in-depth understanding and integration guidelines, refer to the [Next.js Official Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration).
