# How to Change Colors

Most of the time very first thing you want to do is change the colors of the project. You can do that by overriding the color palette of the project. In this case, you can refer [this](/docs/guide/development/theming/override-color-palette) guide.

You can easily override any color like primary, secondary, info, warning, success, error or any other.

Also consider reading official MUI docs on [how to customize MUI palette](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/palette/) and please refer reading [experimental_extendTheme](https://mui.com/material-ui/experimental-api/css-theme-variables/customization/) as we are using MUI's `experimental_extendTheme` and `experimental_extendTheme` API that extends the default theme.
