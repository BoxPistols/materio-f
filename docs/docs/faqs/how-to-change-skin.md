# How to change Skin

We provide `default` skin as the default skin for the template. If a user wants to change the default skin, then go to the `src/configs/themeConfig.ts` file and change the value of the `skin` property as per your requirements. The user may go to the [Theme Configurations](/docs/guide/settings/theme-configurations) docs to see the options available in `skin` as well as for other properties.

If user wants to style something according to the skins, the user can read the current skin in [this](/docs/guide/hooks/useSettings#skin) docs.
