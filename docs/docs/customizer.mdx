## Overview

The customizer is a tool that enables you to customize the appearance of your website in real time. It allows you to make various changes, such as modifying the primary color, mode, skin, layout, direction, etc. to create a personalized and visually appealing site.

## Props

| Name       | Type                                            | Default | Description                                              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| breakpoint | `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `xxl` or `string` | `lg`    | The breakpoint at which the customizer will be collapsed |

If `string` is used, values should be provided in `px`, `rem` or `em`.

## Usage

```tsx
<Customizer breakpoint="lg" />
// or
<Customizer breakpoint="1200px" />
// or
<Customizer breakpoint="75rem" />
```

## How to add customizer in starter-kit

:::caution
Only for those who are using the `starter-kit`
:::

Follow these steps to add customizer in your starter-kit:

1. Copy the `src/@core/components/customizer` folder from the `full-version` and paste it into the same directory of the `starter-kit`
2. Open a layout file (in the `full-version`, the above file is imported & called in the `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` file) and add the following code like we have done in the `full-version`:

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="TSX">

    ```diff
    +import Customizer from '@core/components/customizer'

    const Layout = ({ children }: ChildrenType) => {
      return (
        <Providers>
          ...
    +     <Customizer />
        </Providers>
      )
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="JS">

    ```diff
    +import Customizer from '@core/components/customizer'

    const Layout = ({ children }) => {
      return (
        <Providers>
          ...
    +     <Customizer />
        </Providers>
      )
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

That's it! You can now see the customizer in your starter-kit.

## How to remove customizer from full-version

:::caution
Only for those who are using the `full-version`
:::

To remove the customizer from your full-version, follow these steps:

1. Search for `@core/components/customizer` in the whole template
2. Open the files where the above text is found and remove the following code:

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="TSX">

    ```diff
    -import Customizer from '@core/components/customizer'

    const Layout = ({ children }: ChildrenType) => {
      return (
        <Providers>
          ...
    -     <Customizer />
        </Providers>
      )
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="JS">

    ```diff
    -import Customizer from '@core/components/customizer'

    const Layout = ({ children }) => {
      return (
        <Providers>
          ...
    -     <Customizer />
        </Providers>
      )
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

That's it! The customizer is removed from your full-version.

## How to override or customize template's customizer

To override or customize the template's customizer, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `src/@core/components/customizer` folder and paste it into the `src/components` directory of your project
2. Open the `src/components/customizer/index.tsx` and/or `src/components/customizer/styles.module.css` files and customize them according to your needs
3. Search for `@core/components/customizer` in the whole template and replace it with `@components/customizer`

That's it! Now you can see the customizer is overridden or customized according to your needs.

## How to reset customizer to default themeConfigs

There are two ways to reset the customizer to the default themeConfigs:

1. Click the `Reset` button located at the top-right corner of the customizer next the `Close` button. This will revert any changes made to the customizer
2. Alternatively, you can clear the `settings` from the `localStorage` through the Application/Storage tab in your browser's developer tools. After clearing the settings, refresh the page to restore the default configurations.
